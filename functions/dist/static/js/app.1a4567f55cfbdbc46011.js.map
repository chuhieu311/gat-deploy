gần một năm, cậu quyết định rời tiệm pha lê vì cậu đã có đủ tiền mua một bầy cừu mới, gấp đôi số cừu cậu bán đi hồi trước. Nhưng cậu lại không mua một con cừu nào cả. Bởi vì cậu quyết định đi tìm Truyền thuyết bản thân của mình -Hòn Đá Triết Gia trong giấc mơ kia. Cậu gia nhập đoàn lữ hành đến một sa mạc nơi gần các kim tự tháp. Trong đoàn người, cậu gặp một người Anh đã tìm kiếm những nhà giả kim chân chính suốt 20 năm nay. Người Anh này có hàng thùng sách về thuyết giả kim khiến cậu kinh ngạc. Cậu học được rất nhiều điều dọc đường đi. Đoàn người tiến dần về phía ốc đảo. Khi người Anh nọ thử quan sát sa mạc và học ngôn ngữ sa mạc, thì Edward đọc những cuốn sách của anh ta và học về thuật giả kim. Người Anh nói với cậu rằng mục đích của những nhà giả kim là tinh lọc kim loại bằng cách nung luyện trong nhiều năm. Khi họ tới ốc đảo, đoàn lữ hành được chào đón, và được khuyên phải dừng bước vì có chiến tranh giữa các bộ tộc phía trước. Cậu đã giúp người Anh tìm một nhà giả kim. Và ở nơi đó, cậu gặp Fatima, và yêu cô ngay từ cái nhìn đầu tiên. Fatima là một người phụ nữ sa mạc và cô cũng đã chờ đợi người đàn ông của đời mình từ rất lâu rồi cho tới khi gặp chàng. Trong một lần đánh cược cuộc đời của mình vào trực giác và sự nhạy bén của mình, cậu đã giúp bộ tộc tránh được một cuộc tấn công đột ngột vào ốc đảo. Cậu được thưởng rất nhiều tiền vàng, cùng một lời đề nghị trở thành người cố vấn quan trọng cho trưởng tộc.Cũng chính lúc ấy nhà giả kim ở ốc đảo nhận ra rằng ông đã tìm thấy một học trò xuất sắc. Hiển nhiên đó chính là Santiago. Cậu lưỡng lự khi phải rời ốc đảo vì tình yêu với Fatima cũng như cuộc sống khá giàu sang và danh vọng. Nhưng nhà giả kim đã báo trước cậu sẽ mất đi khả năng nhìn thấy điềm báo, rồi sẽ mất chức và sẽ hối hận vì đã không theo đuổi giấc mơ của mình để đi tìm kho tàng. Sau đó, với sự khích lệ của Fatima, cậu đã rời ốc đảo, lên đường đi tới Kim Tự Tháp. Tới một vùng sa mạc cai quản bởi những chiến binh hung dữ, cậu phải vượt qua những cửa ải, trổ tài biến thành gió, thấu hiểu ngôn ngữ của vũ trụ thì mới được phép đi qua. Tới đây, nhà giả kim từ biệt chàng trai và chàng một mình đi tới chân kim tự tháp. Cậu đã đến được Kim Tự Tháp, rồi lại một lần trắng tay khi đụng độ những tên cướp. Nhưng cậu đã tìm ra vị trí đặt kho báu, ở một nơi rất bất ngờ. Cuối cùng Santiago đã lấy được kho báu, trở lại ốc đảo với niềm vui hân hoan và niềm hạnh phúc tuyệt vời.\"\n            }\n        };\n    },\n    mounted: function mounted() {},\n\n\n    computed:

Người Anh này có hàng thùng sách về thuyết giả kim khiến cậu kinh ngạc. Cậu học được rất nhiều điều dọc đường đi. Đoàn người tiến dần về phía ốc đảo. Khi người Anh nọ thử quan sát sa mạc và học ngôn ngữ sa mạc, thì Edward đọc những cuốn sách của anh ta và học về thuật giả kim. Người Anh nói với cậu rằng mục đích của những nhà giả kim là tinh lọc kim loại bằng cách nung luyện trong nhiều năm. Khi họ tới ốc đảo, đoàn lữ hành được chào đón, và được khuyên phải dừng bước vì có chiến tranh giữa các bộ tộc phía trước. Cậu đã giúp người Anh tìm một nhà giả kim. Và ở nơi đó, cậu gặp Fatima, và yêu cô ngay từ cái nhìn đầu tiên. Fatima là một người phụ nữ sa mạc và cô cũng đã chờ đợi người đàn ông của đời mình từ rất lâu rồi cho tới khi gặp chàng. Trong một lần đánh cược cuộc đời của mình vào trực giác và sự nhạy bén của mình, cậu đã giúp bộ tộc tránh được một cuộc tấn công đột ngột vào ốc đảo. Cậu được thưởng rất nhiều tiền vàng, cùng một lời đề nghị trở thành người cố vấn quan trọng cho trưởng tộc.Cũng chính lúc ấy nhà giả kim ở ốc đảo nhận ra rằng ông đã tìm thấy một học trò xuất sắc. Hiển nhiên đó chính là Santiago. Cậu lưỡng lự khi phải rời ốc đảo vì tình yêu với Fatima cũng như cuộc sống khá giàu sang và danh vọng. Nhưng nhà giả kim đã báo trước cậu sẽ mất đi khả năng nhìn thấy điềm báo, rồi sẽ mất chức và sẽ hối hận vì đã không theo đuổi giấc mơ của mình để đi tìm kho tàng. Sau đó, với sự khích lệ của Fatima, cậu đã rời ốc đảo, lên đường đi tới Kim Tự Tháp. Tới một vùng sa mạc cai quản bởi những chiến binh hung dữ, cậu phải vượt qua những cửa ải, trổ tài biến thành gió, thấu hiểu ngôn ngữ của vũ trụ thì mới được phép đi qua. Tới đây, nhà giả kim từ biệt chàng trai và chàng một mình đi tới chân kim tự tháp. Cậu đã đến được Kim Tự Tháp, rồi lại một lần trắng tay khi đụng độ những tên cướp. Nhưng cậu đã tìm ra vị trí đặt kho báu, ở một nơi rất bất ngờ. Cuối cùng Santiago đã lấy được kho báu, trở lại ốc đảo với niềm vui hân hoan và niềm hạnh phúc tuyệt vời.\"\n            }, {\n                id: 4,\n                name: \"La Thành Bookstop\",\n                time: \"18 tháng 08 năm 2017\",\n                title: \"Ủng hộ sách cho trẻ em nghèo\",\n                imageUrl: \"\",\n                description: \"Sau đó gần một năm, cậu quyết định rời tiệm pha lê vì cậu đã có đủ tiền mua một bầy cừu mới, gấp đôi số cừu cậu bán đi hồi trước.

Nhưng cậu lại không mua một con cừu nào cả. Bởi vì cậu quyết định đi tìm Truyền thuyết bản thân của mình -Hòn Đá Triết Gia trong giấc mơ kia. Cậu gia nhập đoàn lữ hành đến một sa mạc nơi gần các kim tự tháp. Trong đoàn người, cậu gặp một người Anh đã tìm kiếm những nhà giả kim chân chính suốt 20 năm nay. Người Anh này có hàng thùng sách về thuyết giả kim khiến cậu kinh ngạc. Cậu học được rất nhiều điều dọc đường đi. Đoàn người tiến dần về phía ốc đảo. Khi người Anh nọ thử quan sát sa mạc và học ngôn ngữ sa mạc, thì Edward đọc những cuốn sách của anh ta và học về thuật giả kim. Người Anh nói với cậu rằng mục đích của những nhà giả kim là tinh lọc kim loại bằng cách nung luyện trong nhiều năm. Khi họ tới ốc đảo, đoàn lữ hành được chào đón, và được khuyên phải dừng bước vì có chiến tranh giữa các bộ tộc phía trước. Cậu đã giúp người Anh tìm một nhà giả kim. Và ở nơi đó, cậu gặp Fatima, và yêu cô ngay từ cái nhìn đầu tiên. Fatima là một người phụ nữ sa mạc và cô cũng đã chờ đợi người đàn ông của đời mình từ rất lâu rồi cho tới khi gặp chàng. Trong một lần đánh cược cuộc đời của mình vào trực giác và sự nhạy bén của mình, cậu đã giúp bộ tộc tránh được một cuộc tấn công đột ngột vào ốc đảo. Cậu được thưởng rất nhiều tiền vàng, cùng một lời đề nghị trở thành người cố vấn quan trọng cho trưởng tộc.Cũng chính lúc ấy nhà giả kim ở ốc đảo nhận ra rằng ông đã tìm thấy một học trò xuất sắc. Hiển nhiên đó chính là Santiago. Cậu lưỡng lự khi phải rời ốc đảo vì tình yêu với Fatima cũng như cuộc sống khá giàu sang và danh vọng. Nhưng nhà giả kim đã báo trước cậu sẽ mất đi khả năng nhìn thấy điềm báo, rồi sẽ mất chức và sẽ hối hận vì đã không theo đuổi giấc mơ của mình để đi tìm kho tàng. Sau đó, với sự khích lệ của Fatima, cậu đã rời ốc đảo, lên đường đi tới Kim Tự Tháp. Tới một vùng sa mạc cai quản bởi những chiến binh hung dữ, cậu phải vượt qua những cửa ải, trổ tài biến thành gió, thấu hiểu ngôn ngữ của vũ trụ thì mới được phép đi qua. Tới đây, nhà giả kim từ biệt chàng trai và chàng một mình đi tới chân kim tự tháp. Cậu đã đến được Kim Tự Tháp, rồi lại một lần trắng tay khi đụng độ những tên cướp. Nhưng cậu đã tìm ra vị trí đặt kho báu, ở một nơi rất bất ngờ. Cuối cùng Santiago đã lấy được kho báu, trở lại ốc đảo với niềm vui hân hoan và niềm hạnh phúc tuyệt vời.\",\n                imgBook: \"icon_book\",\n                txt_add_book: \"Thêm sách\",\n                txt_number_share: \"Sách cho mượn\",\n                txt_month: \"Tháng \",\n                txt_event: \"SỰ KIỆN\",\n                txt_updating: \"Đang cập nhật\",\n                getTextNumberShareBook: function getTextNumberShareBook(sharingCount) {\n                    return sharingCount + \" \" + this.sharingBook;\n                },\n\n\n                txt_comming_soon: \"Chức năng này đang được phát triển!!!\",\n\n                txt_result: \"kết quả tìm kiếm\",\n                txt_result_for: \"kết quả tìm kiếm cho\",\n\n                txt_suggest_book: \"SÁCH CÙNG THỂ LOẠI\",\n\n                txt_show_more: \"Xem Thêm\",\n                txt_book_detail: \"Chi tiết sách\",\n                txt_descript: \"MÔ TẢ SÁCH\",\n\n                txt_list_share_book: \"Danh sách chia sẻ\",\n                txt_result_seaching: \"Kết quả tìm kiếm\",\n                txt_number_user_share_book: \"Ada Coleman và 27 người khác đang chia sẻ sách\",\n                txt_number_user_share_book_0: \"0 người đang chia sẻ sách\",\n                txt_number_user_share_book_1: \"{1} đang chia sẻ sách\",\n                txt_number_user_share_book_2: \"{0} và {1} người khác đang chia sẻ sách\",\n                txt_number_user_share_book_3: \"{0}, {1} và {2} người khác đang chia sẻ sách\",\n                txt_user_share: \"Người dùng chia sẻ sách\",\n                txt_user_action: [\"Mượn sách\", \"Đợi mượn\", \"Đợi đồng ý\"],\n                txt_record_status: [\"Đợi đồng ý\", \"Đợi đến lượt\", \"Đang liên lạc\", \"Đang mượn\"],\n                txt_action_with_book: \"Muốn đọc\",\n                txt_action_array: [{ status: 2, text: \"Muốn đọc\" }, { status: 1, text: \"Đang đọc\" }, { status: 0, text: \"Đã đọc\" }, { status: -1, text: \"Không\" }],\n                txt_publisher: \"Nhà xuất bản:\",\n\n                txt_comment: \"NHẬN XÉT\",\n                txt_show_more_comment: \"Xem thêm bình luận\",\n                txt_rate_start: \"Đánh giá của bạn\",\n                txt_share_fb: \"Đăng lên facebook\",\n                txt_create_comment: \"Đăng nhận xét\",\n                txt_update_comment: \"Cập nhật\",\n                txt_cancel_update_comment: \"Hủy cập nhật\",\n\n                txt_add_instance: \"Thêm sách vào tủ\",\n                txt_confirm_number_of_adding_book: \"Bạn muốn thêm bao nhiêu cuốn sách?\",\n                txt_sharing: \"Chia sẻ sách tới mọi người\",\n\n                txt_send_message_request: \"Nhắn tin để liên lạc với chủ nhân cuốn sách\",\n                txt_send_message_default: \"Hê lô!!

Nhưng cậu lại không mua một con cừu nào cả. Bởi vì cậu quyết định đi tìm Truyền thuyết bản thân của mình -Hòn Đá Triết Gia trong giấc mơ kia. Cậu gia nhập đoàn lữ hành đến một sa mạc nơi gần các kim tự tháp. Trong đoàn người, cậu gặp một người Anh đã tìm kiếm những nhà giả kim chân chính suốt 20 năm nay. Người Anh này có hàng thùng sách về thuyết giả kim khiến cậu kinh ngạc. Cậu học được rất nhiều điều dọc đường đi. Đoàn người tiến dần về phía ốc đảo. Khi người Anh nọ thử quan sát sa mạc và học ngôn ngữ sa mạc, thì Edward đọc những cuốn sách của anh ta và học về thuật giả kim. Người Anh nói với cậu rằng mục đích của những nhà giả kim là tinh lọc kim loại bằng cách nung luyện trong nhiều năm. Khi họ tới ốc đảo, đoàn lữ hành được chào đón, và được khuyên phải dừng bước vì có chiến tranh giữa các bộ tộc phía trước. Cậu đã giúp người Anh tìm một nhà giả kim. Và ở nơi đó, cậu gặp Fatima, và yêu cô ngay từ cái nhìn đầu tiên. Fatima là một người phụ nữ sa mạc và cô cũng đã chờ đợi người đàn ông của đời mình từ rất lâu rồi cho tới khi gặp chàng. Trong một lần đánh cược cuộc đời của mình vào trực giác và sự nhạy bén của mình, cậu đã giúp bộ tộc tránh được một cuộc tấn công đột ngột vào ốc đảo. Cậu được thưởng rất nhiều tiền vàng, cùng một lời đề nghị trở thành người cố vấn quan trọng cho trưởng tộc.Cũng chính lúc ấy nhà giả kim ở ốc đảo nhận ra rằng ông đã tìm thấy một học trò xuất sắc. Hiển nhiên đó chính là Santiago. Cậu lưỡng lự khi phải rời ốc đảo vì tình yêu với Fatima cũng như cuộc sống khá giàu sang và danh vọng. Nhưng nhà giả kim đã báo trước cậu sẽ mất đi khả năng nhìn thấy điềm báo, rồi sẽ mất chức và sẽ hối hận vì đã không theo đuổi giấc mơ của mình để đi tìm kho tàng. Sau đó, với sự khích lệ của Fatima, cậu đã rời ốc đảo, lên đường đi tới Kim Tự Tháp. Tới một vùng sa mạc cai quản bởi những chiến binh hung dữ, cậu phải vượt qua những cửa ải, trổ tài biến thành gió, thấu hiểu ngôn ngữ của vũ trụ thì mới được phép đi qua. Tới đây, nhà giả kim từ biệt chàng trai và chàng một mình đi tới chân kim tự tháp. Cậu đã đến được Kim Tự Tháp, rồi lại một lần trắng tay khi đụng độ những tên cướp. Nhưng cậu đã tìm ra vị trí đặt kho báu, ở một nơi rất bất ngờ. Cuối cùng Santiago đã lấy được kho báu, trở lại ốc đảo với niềm vui hân hoan và niềm hạnh phúc tuyệt vời.\",\n                imgBook: \"icon_book\",\n                txt_add_book: \"Thêm sách\",\n                txt_number_share: \"Sách cho mượn\",\n                txt_month: \"Tháng \",\n                txt_event: \"SỰ KIỆN\",\n                txt_updating: \"Đang cập nhật\",\n                getTextNumberShareBook: function getTextNumberShareBook(sharingCount) {\n                    return sharingCount + \" \" + this.sharingBook;\n                },\n\n\n                txt_comming_soon: \"Chức năng này đang được phát triển!!!\",\n\n                txt_result: \"kết quả tìm kiếm\",\n                txt_result_for: \"kết quả tìm kiếm cho\",\n\n                txt_suggest_book: \"SÁCH CÙNG THỂ LOẠI\",\n\n                txt_show_more: \"Xem Thêm\",\n                txt_book_detail: \"Chi tiết sách\",\n                txt_descript: \"MÔ TẢ SÁCH\",\n\n                txt_list_share_book: \"Danh sách chia sẻ\",\n                txt_result_seaching: \"Kết quả tìm kiếm\",\n                txt_number_user_share_book: \"Ada Coleman và 27 người khác đang chia sẻ sách\",\n                txt_number_user_share_book_0: \"0 người đang chia sẻ sách\",\n                txt_number_user_share_book_1: \"{1} đang chia sẻ sách\",\n                txt_number_user_share_book_2: \"{0} và {1} người khác đang chia sẻ sách\",\n                txt_number_user_share_book_3: \"{0}, {1} và {2} người khác đang chia sẻ sách\",\n                txt_user_share: \"Người dùng chia sẻ sách\",\n                txt_user_action: [\"Mượn sách\", \"Đợi mượn\", \"Đợi đồng ý\"],\n                txt_record_status: [\"Đợi đồng ý\", \"Đợi đến lượt\", \"Đang liên lạc\", \"Đang mượn\"],\n                txt_action_with_book: \"Muốn đọc\",\n                txt_action_array: [{ status: 2, text: \"Muốn đọc\" }, { status: 1, text: \"Đang đọc\" }, { status: 0, text: \"Đã đọc\" }, { status: -1, text: \"Không\" }],\n                txt_publisher: \"Nhà xuất bản:\",\n                txt_borrowing_book: \"Đang được mượn\",\n\n                txt_comment: \"NHẬN XÉT\",\n                txt_show_more_comment: \"Xem thêm bình luận\",\n                txt_rate_start: \"Đánh giá của bạn\",\n                txt_share_fb: \"Đăng lên facebook\",\n                txt_create_comment: \"Đăng nhận xét\",\n                txt_update_comment: \"Cập nhật\",\n                txt_cancel_update_comment: \"Hủy cập nhật\",\n\n                txt_add_instance: \"Thêm sách vào tủ\",\n                txt_confirm_number_of_adding_book: \"Bạn muốn thêm bao nhiêu cuốn sách?\",\n                txt_sharing: \"Chia sẻ sách tới mọi người\",\n\n                txt_send_message_request: \"Nhắn tin để liên lạc với chủ nhân cuốn sách\",\n                txt_send_message_default: \"Hê lô!!

pha lê vì cậu đã có đủ tiền mua một bầy cừu mới, gấp đôi số cừu cậu bán đi hồi trước. Nhưng cậu lại không mua một con cừu nào cả. Bởi vì cậu quyết định đi tìm Truyền thuyết bản thân của mình -Hòn Đá Triết Gia trong giấc mơ kia. Cậu gia nhập đoàn lữ hành đến một sa mạc nơi gần các kim tự tháp. Trong đoàn người, cậu gặp một người Anh đã tìm kiếm những nhà giả kim chân chính suốt 20 năm nay. Người Anh này có hàng thùng sách về thuyết giả kim khiến cậu kinh ngạc. Cậu học được rất nhiều điều dọc đường đi. Đoàn người tiến dần về phía ốc đảo. Khi người Anh nọ thử quan sát sa mạc và học ngôn ngữ sa mạc, thì Edward đọc những cuốn sách của anh ta và học về thuật giả kim. Người Anh nói với cậu rằng mục đích của những nhà giả kim là tinh lọc kim loại bằng cách nung luyện trong nhiều năm. Khi họ tới ốc đảo, đoàn lữ hành được chào đón, và được khuyên phải dừng bước vì có chiến tranh giữa các bộ tộc phía trước. Cậu đã giúp người Anh tìm một nhà giả kim. Và ở nơi đó, cậu gặp Fatima, và yêu cô ngay từ cái nhìn đầu tiên. Fatima là một người phụ nữ sa mạc và cô cũng đã chờ đợi người đàn ông của đời mình từ rất lâu rồi cho tới khi gặp chàng. Trong một lần đánh cược cuộc đời của mình vào trực giác và sự nhạy bén của mình, cậu đã giúp bộ tộc tránh được một cuộc tấn công đột ngột vào ốc đảo. Cậu được thưởng rất nhiều tiền vàng, cùng một lời đề nghị trở thành người cố vấn quan trọng cho trưởng tộc.Cũng chính lúc ấy nhà giả kim ở ốc đảo nhận ra rằng ông đã tìm thấy một học trò xuất sắc. Hiển nhiên đó chính là Santiago. Cậu lưỡng lự khi phải rời ốc đảo vì tình yêu với Fatima cũng như cuộc sống khá giàu sang và danh vọng. Nhưng nhà giả kim đã báo trước cậu sẽ mất đi khả năng nhìn thấy điềm báo, rồi sẽ mất chức và sẽ hối hận vì đã không theo đuổi giấc mơ của mình để đi tìm kho tàng. Sau đó, với sự khích lệ của Fatima, cậu đã rời ốc đảo, lên đường đi tới Kim Tự Tháp. Tới một vùng sa mạc cai quản bởi những chiến binh hung dữ, cậu phải vượt qua những cửa ải, trổ tài biến thành gió, thấu hiểu ngôn ngữ của vũ trụ thì mới được phép đi qua. Tới đây, nhà giả kim từ biệt chàng trai và chàng một mình đi tới chân kim tự tháp. Cậu đã đến được Kim Tự Tháp, rồi lại một lần trắng tay khi đụng độ những tên cướp.

mới, gấp đôi số cừu cậu bán đi hồi trước. Nhưng cậu lại không mua một con cừu nào cả. Bởi vì cậu quyết định đi tìm Truyền thuyết bản thân của mình -Hòn Đá Triết Gia trong giấc mơ kia. Cậu gia nhập đoàn lữ hành đến một sa mạc nơi gần các kim tự tháp. Trong đoàn người, cậu gặp một người Anh đã tìm kiếm những nhà giả kim chân chính suốt 20 năm nay. Người Anh này có hàng thùng sách về thuyết giả kim khiến cậu kinh ngạc. Cậu học được rất nhiều điều dọc đường đi. Đoàn người tiến dần về phía ốc đảo. Khi người Anh nọ thử quan sát sa mạc và học ngôn ngữ sa mạc, thì Edward đọc những cuốn sách của anh ta và học về thuật giả kim. Người Anh nói với cậu rằng mục đích của những nhà giả kim là tinh lọc kim loại bằng cách nung luyện trong nhiều năm. Khi họ tới ốc đảo, đoàn lữ hành được chào đón, và được khuyên phải dừng bước vì có chiến tranh giữa các bộ tộc phía trước. Cậu đã giúp người Anh tìm một nhà giả kim. Và ở nơi đó, cậu gặp Fatima, và yêu cô ngay từ cái nhìn đầu tiên. Fatima là một người phụ nữ sa mạc và cô cũng đã chờ đợi người đàn ông của đời mình từ rất lâu rồi cho tới khi gặp chàng. Trong một lần đánh cược cuộc đời của mình vào trực giác và sự nhạy bén của mình, cậu đã giúp bộ tộc tránh được một cuộc tấn công đột ngột vào ốc đảo. Cậu được thưởng rất nhiều tiền vàng, cùng một lời đề nghị trở thành người cố vấn quan trọng cho trưởng tộc.Cũng chính lúc ấy nhà giả kim ở ốc đảo nhận ra rằng ông đã tìm thấy một học trò xuất sắc. Hiển nhiên đó chính là Santiago. Cậu lưỡng lự khi phải rời ốc đảo vì tình yêu với Fatima cũng như cuộc sống khá giàu sang và danh vọng. Nhưng nhà giả kim đã báo trước cậu sẽ mất đi khả năng nhìn thấy điềm báo, rồi sẽ mất chức và sẽ hối hận vì đã không theo đuổi giấc mơ của mình để đi tìm kho tàng. Sau đó, với sự khích lệ của Fatima, cậu đã rời ốc đảo, lên đường đi tới Kim Tự Tháp. Tới một vùng sa mạc cai quản bởi những chiến binh hung dữ, cậu phải vượt qua những cửa ải, trổ tài biến thành gió, thấu hiểu ngôn ngữ của vũ trụ thì mới được phép đi qua. Tới đây, nhà giả kim từ biệt chàng trai và chàng một mình đi tới chân kim tự tháp. Cậu đã đến được Kim Tự Tháp, rồi lại một lần trắng tay khi đụng độ những tên cướp. Nhưng cậu đã tìm ra vị trí đặt kho báu, ở một nơi rất bất ngờ. Cuối cùng Santiago đã lấy được kho báu, trở lại ốc đảo với niềm vui hân hoan và niềm hạnh phúc tuyệt vời.\",\r\n    sharingCount: 200, distance: 73239\r\n}\r\nvar arr = [];\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 4;

Cậu gia nhập đoàn lữ hành đến một sa mạc nơi gần các kim tự tháp. Trong đoàn người, cậu gặp một người Anh đã tìm kiếm những nhà giả kim chân chính suốt 20 năm nay. Người Anh này có hàng thùng sách về thuyết giả kim khiến cậu kinh ngạc. Cậu học được rất nhiều điều dọc đường đi. Đoàn người tiến dần về phía ốc đảo. Khi người Anh nọ thử quan sát sa mạc và học ngôn ngữ sa mạc, thì Edward đọc những cuốn sách của anh ta và học về thuật giả kim. Người Anh nói với cậu rằng mục đích của những nhà giả kim là tinh lọc kim loại bằng cách nung luyện trong nhiều năm.

Nhưng nhà giả kim đã báo trước cậu sẽ mất đi khả năng nhìn thấy điềm báo, rồi sẽ mất chức và sẽ hối hận vì đã không theo đuổi giấc mơ của mình để đi tìm kho tàng. Sau đó, với sự khích lệ của Fatima, cậu đã rời ốc đảo, lên đường đi tới Kim Tự Tháp. Tới một vùng sa mạc cai quản bởi những chiến binh hung dữ, cậu phải vượt qua những cửa ải, trổ tài biến thành gió, thấu hiểu ngôn ngữ của vũ trụ thì mới được phép đi qua. Tới đây, nhà giả kim từ biệt chàng trai và chàng một mình đi tới chân kim tự tháp. Cậu đã đến được Kim Tự Tháp, rồi lại một lần trắng tay khi đụng độ những tên cướp.

Nhưng cậu lại không mua một con cừu nào cả. Bởi vì cậu quyết định đi tìm Truyền thuyết bản thân của mình -Hòn Đá Triết Gia trong giấc mơ kia. Cậu gia nhập đoàn lữ hành đến một sa mạc nơi gần các kim tự tháp. Trong đoàn người, cậu gặp một người Anh đã tìm kiếm những nhà giả kim chân chính suốt 20 năm nay. Người Anh này có hàng thùng sách về thuyết giả kim khiến cậu kinh ngạc. Cậu học được rất nhiều điều dọc đường đi. Đoàn người tiến dần về phía ốc đảo. Khi người Anh nọ thử quan sát sa mạc và học ngôn ngữ sa mạc, thì Edward đọc những cuốn sách của anh ta và học về thuật giả kim. Người Anh nói với cậu rằng mục đích của những nhà giả kim là tinh lọc kim loại bằng cách nung luyện trong nhiều năm. Khi họ tới ốc đảo, đoàn lữ hành được chào đón, và được khuyên phải dừng bước vì có chiến tranh giữa các bộ tộc phía trước. Cậu đã giúp người Anh tìm một nhà giả kim. Và ở nơi đó, cậu gặp Fatima, và yêu cô ngay từ cái nhìn đầu tiên. Fatima là một người phụ nữ sa mạc và cô cũng đã chờ đợi người đàn ông của đời mình từ rất lâu rồi cho tới khi gặp chàng. Trong một lần đánh cược cuộc đời của mình vào trực giác và sự nhạy bén của mình, cậu đã giúp bộ tộc tránh được một cuộc tấn công đột ngột vào ốc đảo. Cậu được thưởng rất nhiều tiền vàng, cùng một lời đề nghị trở thành người cố vấn quan trọng cho trưởng tộc.Cũng chính lúc ấy nhà giả kim ở ốc đảo nhận ra rằng ông đã tìm thấy một học trò xuất sắc. Hiển nhiên đó chính là Santiago. Cậu lưỡng lự khi phải rời ốc đảo vì tình yêu với Fatima cũng như cuộc sống khá giàu sang và danh vọng. Nhưng nhà giả kim đã báo trước cậu sẽ mất đi khả năng nhìn thấy điềm báo, rồi sẽ mất chức và sẽ hối hận vì đã không theo đuổi giấc mơ của mình để đi tìm kho tàng. Sau đó, với sự khích lệ của Fatima, cậu đã rời ốc đảo, lên đường đi tới Kim Tự Tháp. Tới một vùng sa mạc cai quản bởi những chiến binh hung dữ, cậu phải vượt qua những cửa ải, trổ tài biến thành gió, thấu hiểu ngôn ngữ của vũ trụ thì mới được phép đi qua. Tới đây, nhà giả kim từ biệt chàng trai và chàng một mình đi tới chân kim tự tháp. Cậu đã đến được Kim Tự Tháp, rồi lại một lần trắng tay khi đụng độ những tên cướp. Nhưng cậu đã tìm ra vị trí đặt kho báu, ở một nơi rất bất ngờ. Cuối cùng Santiago đã lấy được kho báu, trở lại ốc đảo với niềm vui hân hoan và niềm hạnh phúc tuyệt vời.\",\r\n                imgBook: \"icon_book\",\r\n                txt_add_book: \"Thêm sách\",\r\n                txt_number_share: \"Sách cho mượn\",\r\n                txt_month: \"Tháng \",\r\n                txt_event: \"SỰ KIỆN\",\r\n                txt_updating: \"Đang cập nhật\",\r\n                getTextNumberShareBook(sharingCount) {\r\n                    return sharingCount + \" \" + this.sharingBook;\r\n                },\r\n\r\n                txt_comming_soon: \"Chức năng này đang được phát triển!!!\",\r\n\r\n                // Search Book/User Page\r\n                txt_result: \"kết quả tìm kiếm\",\r\n                txt_result_for: \"kết quả tìm kiếm cho\",\r\n\r\n                // Book Detail Page\r\n                txt_suggest_book: \"SÁCH CÙNG THỂ LOẠI\",\r\n                // txt_list_category: [\"Sách hay mỗi ngày\", \"Sách yêu thích\", \"Sách gần bạn\", \"Sách chia sẻ nhiều\"],\r\n                txt_show_more: \"Xem Thêm\",\r\n                txt_book_detail: \"Chi tiết sách\",\r\n                txt_descript: \"MÔ TẢ SÁCH\",\r\n                \r\n                // Book Detail Page - List User Share\r\n                txt_list_share_book: \"Danh sách chia sẻ\",\r\n                txt_result_seaching: \"Kết quả tìm kiếm\",\r\n                txt_number_user_share_book: \"Ada Coleman và 27 người khác đang chia sẻ sách\",\r\n                txt_number_user_share_book_0: \"0 người đang chia sẻ sách\",\r\n                txt_number_user_share_book_1: \"{1} đang chia sẻ sách\",\r\n                txt_number_user_share_book_2: \"{0} và {1} người khác đang chia sẻ sách\",\r\n                txt_number_user_share_book_3: \"{0}, {1} và {2} người khác đang chia sẻ sách\",\r\n                txt_user_share: \"Người dùng chia sẻ sách\",\r\n                txt_user_action: [\"Mượn sách\", \"Đợi mượn\", \"Đợi đồng ý\"],\r\n                txt_record_status: [\"Đợi đồng ý\", \"Đợi đến lượt\", \"Đang liên lạc\", \"Đang mượn\"],\r\n                txt_action_with_book: \"Muốn đọc\",\r\n                txt_action_array: [{ status: 2, text: \"Muốn đọc\" }, { status: 1, text: \"Đang đọc\" }, { status: 0, text: \"Đã đọc\" }, { status: -1, text: \"Không\" }],\r\n                txt_publisher: \"Nhà xuất bản:\",\r\n\r\n                // Book Detail Page - List User Comment\r\n                txt_comment: \"NHẬN XÉT\",\r\n                txt_show_more_comment: \"Xem thêm bình luận\",\r\n                txt_rate_start: \"Đánh giá của bạn\",\r\n                txt_share_fb: \"Đăng lên facebook\",\r\n                txt_create_comment: \"Đăng nhận xét\",\r\n                txt_update_comment: \"Cập nhật\",\r\n                txt_cancel_update_comment: \"Hủy cập nhật\",\r\n\r\n                // Book Detail Page - Add Instance\r\n                txt_add_instance: \"Thêm sách vào tủ\",\r\n                txt_confirm_number_of_adding_book: \"Bạn muốn thêm bao nhiêu cuốn sách?\",\r\n                txt_sharing: \"Chia sẻ sách tới mọi người\",\r\n\r\n                // Book Detail Page - Send Request\r\n                txt_send_message_request: \"Nhắn tin để liên lạc với chủ nhân cuốn sách\",\r\n                txt_send_message_default: \"Hê lô!!

Nhưng cậu lại không mua một con cừu nào cả. Bởi vì cậu quyết định đi tìm Truyền thuyết bản thân của mình -Hòn Đá Triết Gia trong giấc mơ kia. Cậu gia nhập đoàn lữ hành đến một sa mạc nơi gần các kim tự tháp. Trong đoàn người, cậu gặp một người Anh đã tìm kiếm những nhà giả kim chân chính suốt 20 năm nay. Người Anh này có hàng thùng sách về thuyết giả kim khiến cậu kinh ngạc. Cậu học được rất nhiều điều dọc đường đi. Đoàn người tiến dần về phía ốc đảo. Khi người Anh nọ thử quan sát sa mạc và học ngôn ngữ sa mạc, thì Edward đọc những cuốn sách của anh ta và học về thuật giả kim. Người Anh nói với cậu rằng mục đích của những nhà giả kim là tinh lọc kim loại bằng cách nung luyện trong nhiều năm. Khi họ tới ốc đảo, đoàn lữ hành được chào đón, và được khuyên phải dừng bước vì có chiến tranh giữa các bộ tộc phía trước. Cậu đã giúp người Anh tìm một nhà giả kim. Và ở nơi đó, cậu gặp Fatima, và yêu cô ngay từ cái nhìn đầu tiên. Fatima là một người phụ nữ sa mạc và cô cũng đã chờ đợi người đàn ông của đời mình từ rất lâu rồi cho tới khi gặp chàng. Trong một lần đánh cược cuộc đời của mình vào trực giác và sự nhạy bén của mình, cậu đã giúp bộ tộc tránh được một cuộc tấn công đột ngột vào ốc đảo. Cậu được thưởng rất nhiều tiền vàng, cùng một lời đề nghị trở thành người cố vấn quan trọng cho trưởng tộc.Cũng chính lúc ấy nhà giả kim ở ốc đảo nhận ra rằng ông đã tìm thấy một học trò xuất sắc. Hiển nhiên đó chính là Santiago. Cậu lưỡng lự khi phải rời ốc đảo vì tình yêu với Fatima cũng như cuộc sống khá giàu sang và danh vọng. Nhưng nhà giả kim đã báo trước cậu sẽ mất đi khả năng nhìn thấy điềm báo, rồi sẽ mất chức và sẽ hối hận vì đã không theo đuổi giấc mơ của mình để đi tìm kho tàng. Sau đó, với sự khích lệ của Fatima, cậu đã rời ốc đảo, lên đường đi tới Kim Tự Tháp. Tới một vùng sa mạc cai quản bởi những chiến binh hung dữ, cậu phải vượt qua những cửa ải, trổ tài biến thành gió, thấu hiểu ngôn ngữ của vũ trụ thì mới được phép đi qua.
